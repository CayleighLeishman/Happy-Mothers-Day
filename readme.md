This is an interactive 3D card I wanted to create for my mother as a heartfelt tribute to her.
She was the reason I went to university in the first place. If she hadn't shoved --I mean encouraged-- me to go to University 
I probably wouldn't be able to make things like these or understand how to work around it. 

Thank you to my mom for all the things you've done for your children.
